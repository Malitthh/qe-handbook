# Git Training

### Cloning a Repository to Local

1. Install Git: Ensure that Git is installed on your system.
2. Create Folder Structure: Create a folder structure named "Source/Repos/Project" to organize your repositories.
3. Open Git Bash: Navigate to the "Project" folder and open Git Bash there.
4. Copy Clone URL: Obtain the URL of the repository you want to clone (usually provided by the repository hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
5. Clone Repository: In Git Bash, use the command git clone <repository_url> to clone the repository to your local machine.
6. Switch Branch: Use git checkout <branch_name> to switch to the desired branch (replace <branch_name> with the actual branch name).

### Committing Your Changes
1. Check Status: Use git status to see the status of your local branch and the main/master branch.
2. Pull from Main/Master: Run git pull origin main (or master) to update your local branch with the latest changes from the main/master branch.
3. Add Files: Use git add * to stage all changes, or git add <file_name> to stage specific files.
4. Commit Changes: Commit staged changes using git commit -m "commit message" with an appropriate commit message explaining your changes.
5. Pull Again: Perform another git pull origin main to ensure your branch is up-to-date before pushing.
6. Push Changes: Use git push to send your committed changes to the remote repository.
7. Pull Requests (PRs): If your workflow includes pull requests, this step might involve creating a PR for code review.
8. Pull Again: After PR review, do another git pull origin main to incorporate any final changes before proceeding.
9. Check Status: Use git status again to check the status after the pull.

### Commit Message Format
Commit messages should follow a standard format to convey the purpose of the commit. 
You've provided various message types like "feat," "fix," "docs," etc., which help categorize the changes. 
For example:
* feat: for feature additions
* fix: for bug fixes
* docs: for documentation changes
* style: for code style changes
* refactor: for code refactoring
* perf: for performance improvements
* test: for adding tests
* build: for build-related changes
* ci: for CI/CD related changes
* revert: for reverting changes

git commit -m "docs: Correct README formatting"

Each commit message should be concise yet informative.

### Git Merge Conflict Resolution

1. Create a Backup of Your Changes:
   * Manually copy the entire directory of your project to a different location on your computer,
   * Create a zip file of your project directory. This is your backup in case anything goes wrong.
2. Delete Your Current Branch:
   * First, switch to a different branch (like master or main).
     -- git checkout master
   * Then, delete the branch with the changes you want to push.
     -- git branch -D testbranch
3. Pull the Latest Code from the Master Branch:
   * Make sure you have the latest version of the master branch.
     -- git pull origin master
4. Create a New Branch:
   * Create and switch to a new branch.
     -- git checkout -b newtestbranch
5. Copy Your Changes:
   * Copy the changes (except the file you donâ€™t want to include) from your backup into the appropriate locations in your new working directory.
6. Commit and Push Your Changes:
   * Add the changes to the staging area.
     -- git add . or git add *
   * Commit the changes.
     -- git commit -m "refactor: fix code formatting"
   * Push the changes to the remote repository.
     -- git push origin newtestbranch
7. Few points to remember,
     * 7.1 -- git push --set-upstream origin newtestbranch
   * Here's what this command does:
        * git push tells Git to push your commits to the remote repository.
        * --set-upstream (or -u for short) sets the upstream (tracking) reference for the branch.
        * origin is the default name of your remote repository (assuming you haven't renamed it).
        * newtestbranch is your branch name.
        * After running this command, newtestbranch will be pushed to the remote repository, and Git will set up tracking information so that in the future,
        * you can just use git push or git pull without specifying the remote and branch names.
    * 7.2 -- git pull --rebase origin newtestbranch
   * This command will fetch the changes from the remote and then reapply your local changes on top of these updates.
     -- git rebase --continue
   * Once all conflicts are resolved and the changes are added, continue the rebase process with:
     -- git push origin newtestbranch
   * After the rebase is complete and your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch, you can now push your changes:
   * Be Cautious with Rebase: Rebasing rewrites the commit history, which can be problematic, especially if you're working in a shared branch. It's generally safe to rebase if you are the only one working on the branch or if your branch is a local feature branch that hasn't been pushed yet.
   * Regularly Fetch and Pull: Regularly fetching and pulling changes from the remote can help avoid such conflicts.
   * Communicate with Your Team: If you're working in a team, communicate with your teammates when performing operations like rebasing that alter the commit history.

Remember that the provided instructions are just one approach, and Git workflows can vary based on team practices and project requirements. 
It's essential to understand Git concepts and tailor your workflow accordingly.
