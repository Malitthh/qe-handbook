### 01

- Understand the problem well
- Find possible solutions
- Pick the best solution
- Only then start coding 
- Don't start coding without a clear plan.
  
#### Your time is precious, so use it wisely.

### 02

1. Quality over Quantity: Focus on asking insightful questions that delve deep into the problem at hand, rather than bombarding with numerous queries.
2. Grasp the Concepts: Prioritize comprehending the underlying principles and logic behind the code, as opposed to merely churning out lines of code.
3. Elegance in Simplicity: Impress through concise and effective code solutions, rather than aiming for quantity. Elegant solutions often outshine lengthy ones.
4. Purpose-Driven Development: Develop a clear understanding of the purpose and value of the project before diving into coding. Knowing the "why" informs better decision-making during development.
5. Mentorship Matters: Leverage the knowledge and guidance of experienced mentors around you. The presence of mentors can propel your career to new heights through valuable insights and learning opportunities.
